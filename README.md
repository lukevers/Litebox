#Litebox

Litebox is a small alternitive to other light boxes.

##The Idea

Yes, lightboxes have been done over and over. Some require you to add their specific *[jquery](http://jquery.com/)* files, some require you to pay for commercial use, and a lot are made specifically for images and/or videos. **Litebox** is designed to display anything without any hassle. Litebox does not require the use of *jquery* like many other lightboxes.

##Implementation

I'll explain it soon.
